This repository contains implementations of most relevant algorithms that are covered in the course "Algorithmen und
Datenstrukturen" at ETH Zurich (based on the content of the autumn semester 2020):

## Sorting Algorithms
- Heapsort
- Mergesort
- Quicksort

## Graph Algorithms
- DFS
- BFS
- Dijkstra
- Bellman-Ford
- Floyd-Warshall
- Binary Search Tree
- Max-Heap
- Prim
- Kruskal
- Union Find (used for Kruskal)

## DP Algorithms
- Knapsack
  - One constraint, bounded
  - One constraint, unbounded
  - Two constraints, bounded
  - Two constraints, unbounded
- Longest Common Subsequence
- Longest Increasing Subsequence
- Edit distance

## Other Algorithms
- Binary Search

The implementations are meant to work standalone and are optimised for readability, not conciseness.
I give no guarantees that the implementations are correct, however I've tested nearly all of them at some
point.
