This repository contains implementations of most relevant algorithms that are covered in the course "Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen" at ETH Zurich. The implementations are meant to work standalone and are optimised for readability, not conciseness. I give no guarantees that the implementations are correct, however I've tested nearly all of them at some point.
